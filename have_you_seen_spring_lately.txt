- Tech today is dizzying 
- new markets are emerging all the time , new spaces 
- lots of places to focus, and Spring's there 
- what is Spring ? It's Spring Boot, XD, Grails 
- it's version 4, coming end of 2013
- its open source, easy to use, etc. 
- its easy to get started at Spring.IO 
- data and services 
 -- lots of different styles of workloads 
 -- integration is a big problem: sharing data between systems is hard, Spring Integration makes it easy
 -- batch lets you avoid idle computing resources, lets you work in terms of online, interactive versus batch, background workloads. a nice fit with spring Integration
 -- talking to backend systems isn't easy - Spring's got world-class JDBC and NoSQL support with rich APIs for dealing with systems like MongoDB, Redis, etc. One of the most powerful thigns to come out of that is the idea of repositories. 
- web 
 -- todays web applications are not just your desktop browser based applications anymore. theyre web services with multiple clients.
 -- REST powers that story.
 -- security is key to that story.
 -- websockets
 - and of course, once you have web services, the natural destination is HTML5 and mobile 
- deployment
 -- supports Java EE 7 runtimes
 -- works well in the cloud (Cloud Foundry)
